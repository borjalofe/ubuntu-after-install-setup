same actions everytime.

## Intro

Everytime I install Ubuntu in a new laptop, I google _Ubuntu {version} after
install_ and I get lots of posts that -essentially- have the same info. Moreover, this info don't usually change from version to version.

Thus, I've created this project to automate all the actions for each of the jobs I usually do.

Over time, I've tried to expand this script's features to cover other jobs.

## Technologies

After-Install is created with:

- Shellscript

## How to use it

```bash
wget https://github.com/borjalofe/ubuntu-after-install-setup/blob/main/after-install.sh
chmod +x after-install.sh
./after-install.sh
```

`./after-install.sh` displays the following usage message:

```bash
after-install 1.0.0
Usage: after-install [{-h | --help}] [{-a | --angular}] [{-d | --developer}]
                        [{-j | --javascript}] [{-m | --media}] [--nx]
                        [{-q | --quiet}] [{-s | --sysadmin}] [{-v | --verbose}]
                        [{-y | --yes}]

after-install is a script to set up a base environment after a clean Ubuntu
installation.

where:
    -a, --angular       sets up an angular development environment
    -d, --developer     sets up a basic development environment
    -h, --help          show this help text
    -j, --javascript    sets up a javascript development environment
    -m, --media         sets up a media workspace
    --nx                sets up a nx development environment
    -q, --quiet         executes the script without any message
    -s, --sysadmin      sets up a sysadmin environment
    -v, --verbose       print all instructions and comments
    -y, --yes           answer yes to all yes/no questions
```
